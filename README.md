# rustnet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HiroLord/rustnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HiroLord/rustnet)
A networking library using SDL2_net for use in Rust applications.

These functions can be used to easily interface a client and a server without going into the nitty-gritty of networking in SDL2.
